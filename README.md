## GO Todo

Hi, this is just a demo project using the following things:
 - Golang 🦫
 - GH Actions -> Some kind of ci/cd 
 - Testing in Go
 - That's it folks, don't expect much of it. 🦆

### Useful commands

#### To run the project
```
go run cmd/main.go
```

#### To run all the tests (refinement should be done)
```
go test ./...
```

#### To build the project in case you wanna have it running as a binary
```
go build -o ./bin/gotodo ./cmd/main.go
```
#### To actually run the project
```
./bin/gotodo
```
